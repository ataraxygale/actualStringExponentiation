# 🧮 actualStringExponentiation

-Python does not inherently allow the usage of actual string ezponentiation (only string multiplication).
-This program actually exponentiates strings

## 📦 Notes
- This is part of a growing set of small programs documenting my Python learning journey.
- Everything is building ⚙️✨

## 🧠 How It Works
- Prompts the user to enter their desired string to be exponentiated
- Prompts the user to enter the desired exponent amount
- Stores the initial value and immediately exponentiates it by 2
- Stores the exponent amount and repeats the initial equation
- Prints the exponentiated string result

## 🧪 Example Output

- Enter the string you would like exponentiated: 
- hi
- Enter the number of times you would like this exponentiated: 
- 4
- This is your exponentiated string:  hihihihihihihihi
